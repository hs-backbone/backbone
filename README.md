# backbone
Backbone is a set of haskell-libraries that try to provide a better enviroment for doing numerical calculations, without commiting to a specific backend.

The idea is to introduce a number of libraries that can be combined but do not have to be. This should avoid requiring a total buy&lock-in and give the user back control over the complexity.

backbone is based on numhask, and while there are som replacements of typeclasses, it strives to be completely compatible.
